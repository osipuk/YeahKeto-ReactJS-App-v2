      Why our stringent specs may cause a product shortage
    </p>
    <p className="s1txt4">
      We insist on certified US-grown hemp and lab-test to ensure the highest
      concentration of CBD- 500 mg per serving—and our filtration and extraction
      processes mean zero THC. This is what makes our product legal in all 50
      states, no prescription necessary.<br />
      <br />
      Farmers who meet all of our stringent specifications are hard to find. As
      we expand, we will continue to find new sources, but so far we are limited
      to a single farm that meets our standards. This means supply struggles to
      keep up with huge demand.<br />
      <br />
      For this reason, we suggest you ensure an adequate supply, and we’ve
      established these special promotional offers to help you do just that.
